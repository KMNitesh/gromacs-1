This project is now in pre-alpha stage: as soon as a bug-free version will be reached, we will officially release the software adding full documentation and examples. A publication in a peer-reviewed journal shall also follow. Till then, if you use the code, please let us know directly by sending us an email.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n### Go back to [my Homepage on GitHub](http://marcello-sega.github.io/)","google":"UA-52066388-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
